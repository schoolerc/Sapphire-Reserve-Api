#Sapphire Reserve API

##What am I?

This is a repository containing a ruby on rails application, in its infancy, designed to co exist with The Sapphire Reserve.

##Why do I exist?

To provide an RESTful API endpoint for The Sapphire Reserve that can handle up to but maybe more:

* User Authentication
* Storing Session Information
* Storing and Organizing User Generated Content (This actually is a lot more than one bullet but for now this is fine)

##Wow that's so cool!

I know right?

##Except there isn't really a lot of information so...

Currently the focus of my development time is on The Sapphire Reserve site itself because you kinda need someone to consume the API otherwise having an API doesn't do you much.
There are also features of the site that won't require this API and I'd like to complete those first.

If you're interested at all in either project, I'm open to other contributors at the moment.
